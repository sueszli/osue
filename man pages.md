Here is a short list of the man pages I found most helpful in this course (check out the `manExamples.py` script in this directory to find more of them for yourself!):

*getopt*

- `man 3 getopt`
- `man 3 string`

*shared memory*

- `man 3 shm_open`
- `man 7 sem_overview`
- `man 7 shm_overview`

*fork, pipe, execle*

- `man 2 pipe` - also has fork
- `man 2 dup2`
- `man 2 wait`
- `man 3 system`

*socket*

- `man 2 select_tut` - also has sigaction
- `man 7 unix` - has overview
- `man 3 getaddrinfo` - fallback, if no ipv4 given
